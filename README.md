### Why I Found This Article Interesting

As someone with a background in User Experience Design, I understand the importance of human-centric software development and how it can enhance a user's interaction with a product. However, I find that many people fail to see the value a human-centric approach brings to the field of software development. This article does a solid job of laying down the principles of human-centric software development, emphasizing its importance, & providing concrete ways of putting it into practice.
